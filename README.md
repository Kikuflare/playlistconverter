A short Python script for converting playlists in the .m3u8 format to .wpl.

Long story short, I made this script to convert .m3u8 playlists generated by
foobar2000 into .wpl for use in Windows Media Player. I don't actually use WMP,
but because the playlist function of the portable music player I use only
works with playlists synced from WMP, I am forced to use WMP occasionally. I
normally use foobar2000, which doesn't allow you to save playlists in .wpl
format. This script lets me use my playlists from foobar2000 in WMP which I
then sync to my PMP device.

The moral of the story is don't use PMPs that require WMP for playlists.
Or don't keep playlists with over 1000 songs. I don't know.

How to use:
I included a version for Python 2 and Python 3. Use playlistconverter.py if you
have Python 3 installed, and use playlistconverter2.py if you use Python 2. Put
the .m3u8 you want to convert to .wpl in the same folder as playlistconverter.py
and run:

python playlistconverter.py <yourfilename>

You should get a valid .wpl file. Send me a message if it doesn't work with WMP.
